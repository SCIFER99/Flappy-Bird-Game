# Flappy-Bird-Game
This program is a version of Flappy Bird, Its not exact, but its close enough.

What goin on you guys! I just finished developing the Flappy Bird Game!
I loved this because I always make sure ot challenge myself in Python software development!
The only thin that is missing is showing "Game Over" when the player hits any of the pipes. 
Other than that, the game is complete! Use the Up-Arrow key to start the game.

# Developed in Python version 3.10.8

PS: I forgot to mention that I have been and will continue developing 
video games in Python version 3.10.8.

Packages needed:

    pip install pygame
    pip install sys
    pip install random
    
Happy Coding!
